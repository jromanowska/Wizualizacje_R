# PLAN

## Wstęp - jak projektować grafikę?
## Krótko o ggplot2
## Interaktywne grafy
### na szybko
### i trochę wolniej / zaawansowane techniki

---

*For a graph to be effective, it must be easy for its audience to decode and interpret.*

---

## Wstęp - jak projektować grafikę?

- eksploruj dane
- wypróbuj różne typy grafów **na kartce!**
- wybierz kolorystykę
- jaką wiadomość przekazuje grafika?

--

- dobre książki:

## tips and tricks

- **kolory**
  - [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org)    
  wbudowane w ggplot2 [`scale_color_brewer`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_brewer.html)
  - [sanzo palette](https://github.com/jmaasch/sanzo)    
  można zainstalować z CRANa
  - mnóstwo innych możliwości: np. [paletteer](https://emilhvitfeldt.github.io/paletteer/)

- **roszerzenia**
  - [ggrepel](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/)    
  ładniejsze pozycjonowanie napisów
  - [gggenes](https://wilkox.org/gggenes/)    
  wizualizacja genów jako strzałek
  - mnóstwo innych możliwości: [ggextensions](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/)

# Interaktywne grafy

## na szybko

---

&lt;div style="float: right; position: fixed; right: 10px; top: 10px;"&gt;
&lt;img style="float: right; position: relative;" src="ggiraph_logo.png" alt="ggiraph"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## ggiraph

https://davidgohel.github.io/ggiraph

- do gotowego grafu `ggplot` dodaje interaktywność
- rozszerza `ggplot2` o `geom`y:
    - `geom_point_interactive`
    - `geom_tile_interactive`
    - `scale_fill_manual_interactive`
    - i wiele więcej

## highcharter

https://jkunst.com/highcharter/

- implementacja R biblioteki javascript [`highcharts`](https://www.highcharts.com/demo)
- trochę jak ggplot:

    - dodajemy warstwy danych funkcją `hc_add_series`
    - dodajemy warstwy wizualne funkcją `hcaes`
    - szybkie rysowanie przez funkcję `hchart`
    - dodajemy elementy przez odpowiednie funkcje `hc_`,    
    np. `hc_title` dodaje tytuł,    
    `hc_colorAxis` definiuje paletę kolorów i dodaje legendę

--

- mnóstwo przykładów:    
https://jkunst.com/highcharter/articles/showcase.html

- bardziej zaawansowany przykład:    
https://jrom.bitbucket.io/showcase/
- kod: https://bitbucket.org/jrom/jrom.bitbucket.io/src/master/showcase/index.Rmd

## Interaktywny Rmarkdown

- [flexdashboard](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/index.html)

    - Rmarkdown z ekstra opcjami
    - dzięki `htmlwidgets` można łatwo umieszczać interaktywne komponenty
    - dzięki `crosstalk` można łączyć komponenty

- [htmlwidgets](https://www.htmlwidgets.org/)

    - wybierz spośród gotowych funkcji R
    - kompilacja do JS i HTML

- [crosstalk](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/)

    - dodaj zależności pomiędzy komponentami
